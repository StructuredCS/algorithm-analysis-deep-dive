# Algorithm Analysis Deep Dive

## ðŸ“˜ Course Overview

Algorithm Analysis Deep Dive began as a part of a flipped classroom experience designed for college students. But as the lectures went online, I realized they were helping a much wider audience â€” especially self-taught programmers and bootcamp graduates who never had the chance to study algorithm analysis rigorously. That's why I've decided to open access the course, and share the full learning experience.

This is not just a coding tutorial â€” it's a university-level exploration of how to analyze algorithms and data structures with mathematical precision. We emphasize understanding why algorithms work, not just how to write them, and focus heavily on deriving and reasoning about time complexity.

The course is organized into weekly modules. Each week includes curated lecture videos, quizzes, and hands-on coding labs with automated feedback. You can:

## ðŸ§  Who This Course Is For

This course is designed for anyone who wants to deepen their understanding of algorithm analysis and time complexity. It's particularly useful for:

* Self-taught programmers looking to fill gaps in algorithm analysis
* Bootcamp graduates who want to go beyond surface-level DSA
* Students preparing for coding interviews who struggle with complexity analysis
* Students who've taken an algorithms course before but found the math abstract, non-intuitive, or disconnected from the actual code
* Anyone who's tried to memorize time complexity by brute force â€” and now wants to truly understand it

The prerequisites are minimal:

* a basic understanding of programming concepts
* a basic understanding of linear data structures, such as arrays and linked lists
* a basic understanding of recursion and iteration
* a basic understanding of at least one programming language (Python, Java, C++, etc.)

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of:

* Core mathematical tools: asymptotic notation, recurrence tree method, substitution method, and the master theorem
* Complexity analysis techniques: worst-case, average-case, probabilistic, and amortized analysis
* Sorting algorithms: insertion sort, quicksort, mergesort, heapsort
* Data structures: heaps, hashtables, and binary search trees
* The divide-and-conquer paradigm and how to analyze its time complexity
* How to analyze the time complexity of algorithms using mathematical reasoning
* How to analyze the time complexity of data structures

## ðŸ§ª Weekly Content & Interactive Assignments

This course is more than just lectures â€” it's a full learning experience designed to help you apply what you've learned and get feedback automatically, just like a structured university course. The course is structured to be language-agnostic. Each week comes with:

* A set of lecture videos (YouTube playlist)
* One or more conceptual assignments or quizzes
* Hands-on coding labs where you'll write and test algorithms

Labs use GitHub, Github Actions and GitHub Classroom, where you'll:

* Submit your code via version control
* **Receive immediate automated feedback via GitHub Actions**
* Learn through test-driven development
* You don't need to be enrolled anywhere â€” just a GitHub account is enough to participate.

The current lab setup is designed for Java. The setups for other languages are in the works, and they will be added when ready.
